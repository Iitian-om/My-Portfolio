### What You Should Do:
1. Replace placeholder text (e.g., `your-username`, `your-email@example.com`, live link, etc.) with actual information.
2. Add any additional sections if needed (e.g., testimonials, blog links).
3. Include a preview image or GIF of your portfolio to make the README more visually engaging.
